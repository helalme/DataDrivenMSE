## Uncertainty reduction in homogenization problems (URHP)

In this folder, few jypyter notebooks have been presented showing how to reduce uncertainty in homogenization problems avoiding bias and variance. How to estimate the size of a truly statistically equivalent representative volume element (SERVE) is also shown. The technique of how to achieve high accuracy using a very small dataset and avoiding huge computation has demonstrated with various architecture of LSTM network.
